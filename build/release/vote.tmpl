FAQ

=================================
How can I help test this release?
=================================

If you are a Kyuubi user, you can help us test this release by taking
an existing Kyuubi workload and running on this release candidate, then
reporting any regressions.

In the Java/Scala, you can add the staging repository to your projects resolvers
and test with the RC (make sure to clean up the artifact cache before/after so
you don't end up building with a out of date RC going forward).

==============================================================
What should happen to GitHub issues still targeting {version}?
==============================================================

Committers should look at those and triage. Extremely important bug fixes,
documentation, and API tweaks that impact compatibility should be worked on
immediately. Everything else please retarget to an appropriate release.

=======================
But my bug isn't fixed?
=======================

In order to make timely releases, we will typically not hold the release unless
the bug in question is a regression from the previous release. That being said,
if there is something which is a regression that has not been correctly targeted
please ping me or a committer to help target the issue.
