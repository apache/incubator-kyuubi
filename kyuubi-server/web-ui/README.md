### Start Using

For the best experience, we recommend using `node 16.15.1` and `pnpm 7.9.0`.
You can learn how to install the corresponding version from their official website.

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install Dependencies

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Development Project

To do this you can change the VITE_APP_DEV_WEB_URL parameter variable as the service url in .env.development in the project root directory, such as http://127.0. 0.1:8090


```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Build Project

```shell
pnpm run build
```

### Code Format

Usually after you modify the code, you need to perform code formatting operations to ensure that the code in the project is the same style.

```shell
pnpm run prettier
```
